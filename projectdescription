what i learned from this project
1. How to create a static website using django. 
2. learned how to set up app and project .py files such as settings.py, urls.py views.py and models.py
3. when copying from the PPT, make sure every code is correct including the small ",.)("

what challenges:

so many bugs, have to google many errors came accross. 
some time i create a table and it wont show table columns in the database

what was the most fun part.

being applying all the knowledge learned from the class and make the website working is the most fun part.
